Bug List:

1. isEmpty() will always return True, even when the Linked List is not empty.
2. addBack() functions in the same way as addFront, placing the new value in the incorrect space.
3. removeFront() does not remove any values, thus always returns False because it never removes anything.
4. removeBack() does not remove any values, thus always returns False because it never removes anything.
5. Neither removeFront() or removeBack() change size, which is good in this case since they don't do anything, but normally would be a bug.
6. For all of the values in addFront(), addBack(), and search(), it accepts any type not just ints.  Not sure if this is a bug since all the comments simply say type T, but figured I'd mention it.
